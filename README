JMXRemote support for JDK 1.3/JRE 1.3
-------------------------------------

This is a fork of the JMXRemote project that you can find at:
https://jmxremote.dev.java.net/

There you can also find additional information regarding this project.


For building this version you will need:

- UUID
	http://johannburkard.de/software/uuid/
	Download the UUID 2.1.5 version for Java 4 or smaller.
	
- backport-util-concurrent
	http://backport-jsr166.sourceforge.net/
	Download the 3.1 version for Java 1.2

- Sun JMX RI 
	As JMX comes only since Java 1.5 you have to download the RI from
	http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/core/mntr-mgmt/javamanagement/download.jsp
	
This library can be useful when you are working on Java ME project and wish to use 
JMX with the JMXRemote library.
